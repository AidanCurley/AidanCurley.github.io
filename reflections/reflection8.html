								<h3>Introduction</h3>
								<p>Before the module began, I felt like I had a good grasp of what it might contain as I
									previously completed an MA. I was looking forward to discovering the differences between
									a ‘standard’ research project and a project in the field of computer science. I was
									particularly interested in the insight that this module would provide on the format o
									f my dissertation project. The module was split into four distinct parts (for me at least).
								<p>&nbsp;</p>
								<h3>Part 1 - Ethics</h3>
								<p>The first focussed on ethics in research. There were some stimulating discussions in the
								forums about the case studies that we evaluated and summarised, and I felt positive about
								moving forwards into the module.<br>
								One major disappointment was that I learned the fortnightly seminars were to be held at
								9am on Wednesdays. This made it impossible for me to attend due to work commitments, and
								effectively turned the module into a completely online experience. In previous modules,
								I have always been a regular attendee at seminars, only missing one seminar from the
								previous five modules combined. I always found them a great way to build relationships
								with the tutor and other students on the course - online forum posts are no replacement
								for live synchronous chat. <br>
								When I first heard about the schedule, I felt quite annoyed to be honest. I soon realised
								that there are participants from all over the world, in various time zones, and in
								previous modules, when I considered the seminars to be at convenient times, there were
								always some who had unsuitable schedules. I felt a bit selfish that I had initially jumped
								to conclusions, and resolved to suck it up and watch the recordings ensuring I was not
								missing important content.
								<p>&nbsp;</p>

								<h3>Part 2 - Literature Review and Research Methods</h3>
								<p>The first focussed on ethics in research. There were some stimulating discussions in
									the forums about the case studies that we evaluated and summarised, and I felt positive
									about moving forwards into the module.<br>
								One major disappointment was that I learned the fortnightly seminars were to be held at
									9am on Wednesdays. This made it impossible for me to attend due to work commitments,
									and effectively turned the module into a completely online experience. In previous
									modules, I have always been a regular attendee at seminars, only missing one seminar
									from the previous five modules combined. I always found them a great way to build
									relationships with the tutor and other students on the course - online forum posts
									are no replacement for live synchronous chat.<br>
								When I first heard about the schedule, I felt quite annoyed to be honest. I soon realised
									that there are participants from all over the world, in various time zones, and in
									previous modules, when I considered the seminars to be at convenient times, there
									were always some who had unsuitable schedules. I felt a bit selfish that I had initially
									jumped to conclusions, and resolved to suck it up and watch the recordings ensuring
									I was not missing important content.
								<p>&nbsp;</p>

								<h3>Part 3 - Statistics</h3>
								<p>The practical statistics exercises were challenging, but I enjoyed doing them. I like
									maths. Once again, however, I found it difficult to see how this would be relevant
									to my own dissertation. <br>
									I did the work that was required, but honestly felt like I was just ticking some boxes.
									The fact that I had not really communicated with anybody else on the module, was by now,
									also beginning to demotivate me. I procrastinated a lot - leaving some of the formative
									assignments till the end of the module.<br>
									This is not a good way to work. I will really need to be more dedicated in completing
									the tasks during my dissertation module. I will be working alone. Some of the work will
									be less interesting than other parts, and I will need to ensure I do not start procrastinating and
									neglecting or postponing tasks. I plan to do this by creating a timeline for the dissertation
									in JIRA. I will have work separated out over each of the 30 weeks of the project and
									a strict time limit for each section’s completion. I use JIRA at work, and find it a
									great tool for dividing work into smaller pieces and tracking the progress on each of
									the tasks. The fact that I am familiar with the tool, and log in every day as part
									of my job should contribute to a successful project.
								<p>&nbsp;</p>

								<h3>Part 4 - Research Proposal</h3>
								<p>The second assignment required us to produce a proposal for a research project. This
									is good practice for my upcoming dissertation. I did a fair amount of reading into
									how to write a research proposal, and decided to stick to the same area I had studied
									for the literature review.<br>
									The fact that the proposal was to be submitted as a recorded presentation meant that
									I was a little unsure of the formality required. Of course, a written research proposal
									should be written in formal academic English, but I believed that an oral presentation
									of the proposal surely should be less formal, and consist of more than just reading
									my proposal over a couple of slides. This was an error on my part. In future, when I
									am unsure about something or I think something is unclear, I need to be proactive in
									seeking clarification. It is my responsibility to ensure that I know what is expected,
									and this is definitely something I will bear in mind when writing my dissertation.
								<p>&nbsp;</p>
								<h3>Conclusion</h3>
								<p>I learned some good practical skills in this module, particularly how to structure
									and write a literature review, how to formulate a research question, and how to
									present a research proposal. </p>
