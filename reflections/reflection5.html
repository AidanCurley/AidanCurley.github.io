								<h3>Overview</h3>
								<p>The module focussed on the various approaches to managing a software project, namely waterfall and the numerous
									Agile methodologies, the stages of a software project including requirements gathering, project planning,
									<a href="../reflections/reflection5.html">cost estimation</a>, risk assessment, and software quality monitoring
									and management. There was some academic reading and investigation of planning methodologies, testing techniques
									and estimation tools, but the bulk of the learning was achieved through the completion of a team project:
									planning and delivering a software application.
								<h3>Agile SCRUM</h3>
								<p>The first decision facing our team was choosing which project management methodology we were going to follow.
									It was obvious that we should choose an agile framework, as our customers (the other team) hadn’t chosen their
									requirements when the 10 week schedule began. One of the initial tasks in the assignment was to gather the requirements
									from the customer, refining them until each one was  SMART, measurable and deliverable. While this was in
									progress, we wanted to start the development of the system which we could later iterate on as the requirements
									were solidified. The waterfall approach to SEPM relies on the upfront gathering of requirements and detailed
									planning and risk analysis before any development takes place, and was therefore thoroughly unsuited to our
									tight delivery timeframe.
								<p>After settling on Agile, we needed to choose which ‘flavour’. Due to our lack of prior experience, we decided
								to follow SCRUM as it is widely used in industry, is based upon repeated sprints of development to deliver
								functionality and value in a timely manner, and has a clear framework of roles and rituals to follow.
								<p>Though, ultimately, our project was successfully delivered on time, I believe that there were a number of
								problems with the chosen methodology. Some stem from our ‘implementation’ of SCRUM, but others, I believe,
								may be issues with the SCRUM approach itself.
								<h3>Our implementation</h3>
								<p>SCRUM is a lightweight AGILE methodology based on teamwork, good communication, short sprints of development,
									and continuous improvement and refinement of the development process. It contains a number of roles for team
									members and regular rituals/meetings <strong>(Schwaber & Beedle, 2002)</strong>. The first and most important
									ceremony of SCRUM is the daily stand-up, where members of the development team meet to speak briefly about what
									they did, what they are doing, and what blockers or issues they are facing. The idea is that through daily
									communications, the team can stay informed about progress, and the product manager or team lead can pivot
									the team to a new direction should the need arise.
									<p>Another important ceremony in SCRUM is the retro meeting. After each sprint, the team meets as a whole to
								discuss what went well, what didn’t, and take action to improve the next sprint. The retro meeting is essential to
								bring value to the iterative sprint process as it helps teams continually improve and avoid repeating the mistakes
								of previous sprints <strong>(Dalton, 2019)</strong>.
								<h3>Our Issues</h3>
								<p>We did not have daily stand-ups. Our weekly meetings were often not fully attended and the agenda generally
									discussed our progress on the assignment. It was difficult to know what other developers were working on.
									I mean, we could see which story they were working on by looking at our
									<a href="https://gp2-sepm-nov-2021.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/SGN2/boards/1/backlog?sprintCompleted">JIRA board</a>,
									which was usually kept up-to-date, but the details of the story’s implementation and the challenges faced
									are not recorded on the JIRA tickets.
								<p>We did not conduct formal retrospective meetings. This was a serious oversight on our part. Arguably, the
								most valuable aspect of Agile methodologies like SCRUM is that the short development cycles enable continuous
								refinement of the development process where each iteration learns from the previous one.
								<p>The ‘push’ methodology, which before a sprint begins defines the work to be done, relies on the ability of
								the team to predict how much work they can get through in the sprint. This, however, relies on team members
								being able to accurately predict how many hours they are likely to work on the codebase. While this may be a
								simple calculation in professional environment, where developers work a certain number of hours per week, and
								their career depends on it, in a part-time university project environment, the same external motivations of money
								and career do not apply, and it is unrealistic to expect developers on a project like this to treat it with the
								same dedication as they would their job.

								<h3>My thoughts</h3>
								<p>It could be argued that as we did not implement the two main SCRUM rituals, we did not actually implement SCRUM
									at all but some bastardised version of SCRUMbut, i.e. SCRUM but we didn’t do this, and we didn’t do that.
									However, I wonder if SCRUM is actually a good choice for a part-time project where developers cannot or do
									not meet regularly, and where the time each team member commits to the project fluctuates depending on their
									external commitments.
								<p>In this situation, perhaps KANBAN might have been a wiser choice. KANBAN is based on a pull methodology, where
								work is begun when the team is ready to pull the work from ‘To Do’ to ‘In Progress’. Kanban limits the work in
								progress to increase throughput. It also requires less structure, with defined roles for team members deemed unnecessary
								<strong>(Ahmad et al., 2013)</strong>.
								<p>In fact, since the end of our project, I have spent some time investigating the differences between KANBAN and
								SCRUM and research conducted into the efficacy of both approaches. A 2017 study analysed a number of projects conducted
								in KANBAN and SCRUM. It reported that both approaches led to successful projects, though KANBAN was deemed slightly
								better at meeting project schedules <strong>(Lei et al., 2017)</strong>. My research into why our implementation of
								SCRUM was not as successful as it might have been has led me to a 2013 empirical study into the reasons behind SCRUM
								failing <strong>(Eloranta et al., 2013)</strong>. This paper identified SCRUM anti-patterns, common deviations from
								the prescriptive SCRUM methodology which resulted in the failure of projects. Four of our project’s issues made the
								list of ten anti-patterns: sprints being too long, testing happening after development (sometimes in a separate sprint),
								unordered product backlog and invisible progress.
								<p>Discovering this paper before our project began might have helped us avoid these common pitfalls. I believe that
								my future implementations of SCRUM methodology will be much improved. I plan to do this in the next module
