									<h3>Object-Oriented Information Systems</h3>
								</header>
                                <p>The module focussed on the use of object-oriented design and implementation in information systems. We
                                covered system failures, and the reasons for their occurrences, system design using UML diagrams, and
                                object-oriented programming principles, such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, while using
                                Python for their implementation.
                                </p><strong>The importance of testing</strong>
                                <p>My first takeaway from the initial discussions around system failure concerned the importance of testing.
                                Though many of the specific incidences discussed by my peers on the forum were the result of hackers, malware,
                                or malicious use, in general, a number of the incidences involved database and software failure which was
                                preventable with better design. Comprehensive testing of applications, including unit testing, functional
                                testing, integration testing can help identify potential weaknesses in the system and prevent loss of service
                                and the financial cost of such incidents.
                                </p>
                                </p><strong>UML Diagrams and Design</strong>
                                <p>Though I had seen class diagrams and entity relationship diagrams before this module, this was still a steep
                                learning curve for me. I found the lucidchart software reasonably user-friendly and got to grips with the different
                                styles of diagram pretty quickly. I found the sequence diagrams particularly useful as they forced me to look
                                at the processes and flows that were needed in the software, and also helped me to identify the communication
                                lines required between the different objects.
                                </p>
                                <p>I found it particularly challenging to come up with comprehensive, detailed and accurate class diagrams
                                when given a set of requirements. They are pretty useful for providing an overview of the structure of an existing
                                OO system, and outside of this module, in my professional life, I find detailed class diagrams very informative,
                                and a great way to get to grips with the architecture and make-up of an already existing system. However, I
                                am unconvinced of their use as a detailed planning tool for systems that have yet to be implemented. For example,
                                in my final project for this module, my implementation differs significantly from my initial blueprints. Planning
                                a system in its entirety before writing a single line of code (the waterfall methodology) did not seem to benefit
                                my project proportionally to the work involved. Getting accurate blueprints of a system would require a lot more
                                communication and clarification with the stakeholders than just an initial brief of written requirements.
                                I currently work in an agile development environment where building a minimum viable product and then iterating on
                                it, with consistent repeated feedback from the product team, is the norm. Now, having tried the waterfall method, I
                                appreciate more why most software teams these days are moving to a more agile development framework.
                                </p>
                                <p>Having said that, drawing an initial high-level less detailed diagram, then building it, then revisiting the
                                diagram and filling in the details, seems to me to be a productive way of using UML diagrams.
