									<h3>Object-Oriented Information Systems</h3>
								</header>
                                <p>The module focussed on the use of object-oriented design and its implementation in information systems. We
									covered system failures, the reasons for their occurrences, system design using UML diagrams, the principles
									of object-oriented design, such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and how these principles
                                    are implemented in Python.
                                </p><strong>The importance of testing</strong>
                                <p>My first takeaway from the initial discussions around system failure concerned the importance of testing.
                                    Though many of the specific incidents discussed by my peers on the forum had been caused by malicious use,
                                    a number of the incidents involved database and software failure which could have been prevented with better
                                    design. Comprehensive testing of applications, including unit testing, functional testing, and integration
                                    testing can help identify potential weaknesses in a system and prevent system failure, loss of service and
									the negative financial impact of such incidents.
                                </p><strong>UML Diagrams and Design</strong>
                                <p>Though I had seen class diagrams and entity relationship diagrams before this module, this was still a steep
                                    learning curve for me. I found the lucidchart software reasonably user-friendly and got to grips with the
                                    different styles of diagram pretty quickly. I found the sequence diagrams particularly useful as they forced
                                    me to look at the processes and flows that the software required, and also helped me identify the lines of
									communication required between the different objects.
                                </p>
                                <p>I found it particularly challenging to come up with comprehensive, detailed and accurate class diagrams
                                    from the requirements. I think such diagrams can provide a good structural overview of an existing
                                    object-oriented system. In my professional life, I find detailed class diagrams very informative, and an
									effective way to get to grips with the architecture and make-up of an already existing system. However, I am
									unconvinced of their use as a detailed planning tool for systems that have yet to be implemented.
								</p>
								<p>For example, in my "Marketplace" application, the final implementation differs significantly from the diagrams
                                    I produced in the planning stage. Planning a system in its entirety before writing a single line of code (the
									waterfall methodology) did not yield benefits proportional to the work involved. Producing accurate blueprints
                                    of a system would require a lot more communication and clarification with the stakeholders, and might still
									result in designs that would be modified during the implementation as problems were discovered.
                                </p>
                                <p>I currently work in an agile development environment where building a minimum viable product and then iterating
                                    on it, with consistent repeated feedback from the product team, is the norm. Now, having tried the waterfall
                                    method, I appreciate more why many software development teams these days are moving to a more agile project
									management framework.
                                </p>
                                <p>Having said that, drawing an initial high-level less detailed diagram before implementation, then revisiting
                                    the diagram after the initial implementation to fill in the details so future developers can get an overview
									of the project, seems to me to be a productive way of using UML diagrams.
                                </p><strong>Implementing OOP in Python</strong>
                                <p>I had some foundational knowledge of Python before the start of this module. I had also done a couple of courses
                                    in Object-Oriented Programming using Java, but I had not really looked into using Python strictly as an
                                    object-oriented language. I found the implementation of the classes pretty straightforward but Python, without
                                    using external libraries, lacks some of the important components of the OOP paradigm, like interfaces for example,
                                    which allow for loosely coupled code and reduced dependencies. This led to some initial confusion on my part
                                    about how I was to implement my design. Python does, however, allow multiple inheritance which effectively lessens
                                    the need for interfaces. This led to my implementation diverging from my design at the very early stages.
                                </p>
                                <p>This was only my second time using the Flask framework, and I found that when I was unsure of how to do something,
                                    I could get most of what I needed from the documentation. This was a good confidence boost for me, because when
                                    I started coding in April 2020, most documentation seemed impenetrably dense, and I generally ended up watching
                                    videos on Youtube to get a grasp of new concepts. Going forwards, I will definitely be less reluctant to search
                                    in the documentation for what I need.
                                </p><strong>Test-Driven Development</strong>
                                <p>The most important lesson I learnt from the development of the project was the effectiveness of test-driven
                                    development.  I decided to experiment with TDD for this project as I had never used this approach before. Writing
                                    the unit tests for my classes before implementing them was a complete reversal of how I had previously developed.
                                    The idea behind TDD is that, first, you write a suite of tests which test for the desired behaviour of your
                                    classes BEFORE writing any of the classes themselves. I found that this really helped me be specific about what
                                    I expected the class and its methods to be able to do. After I had a set of tests, I could then code the class
                                    and its methods gaining immediate feedback on the accuracy and efficacy of my code.
                                </p>
                                <p>There were, of course, a couple of issues with this approach, as a test will only check what it is designed to.
									In a couple of cases my tests didn't cover edge cases effectively and despite having a passing set of tests,
									I still ended up with anumber of bugs at run-time.
                                </p><strong>Security</strong>
                                <p>One of the aspects of software design and implementation I realise that I need to work on is security. The web
                                    application I coded had a number of security flaws, and was particularly susceptible to attack by SQL injection.
                                    From the sign-in page, it was possible to gain access directly into the database by entering the string <strong>
                                    '' OR 1=1 --</strong>. There are not only issues with my implementation, but also with the design. Application
                                    security is something that needs to be considered in the design phase, as well as by the coder implementing the design.
                                </p>
                                <p>As a result, I intend to spend some time learning how to avoid or prevent SQL injection attacks using
                                    Python. For a small university project like this, it was not a major issue, but in real life professional
                                    development situations, the security of your database and code base is of the utmost importance.
