									<h3>Reflecting on UML class diagrams (Part 1)</h3>
								</header>
                                <p>In week 3, we were set a task to design a UML diagram for a supermarket.</p>
								<strong><p>TASK:</strong>
                                Create an object model to represent a supermarket, for example, you might like to consider the some but exclusively all of the following: Staff, Products, Customers, Online orders, Loyalty schemes.
                                Consider how you might represent inheritance within your model and where you might use composition.</p>
                                <p></p>
                                <img src="images/Supermarket UML.png" alt="Supermarket UML diagram">
                                <p>This was only my second ever attempt at a UML class diagram, and by far the most invloved.
                                I found it really challenging to come up with all of the necessary attributes and methods for each of the classes.
                                I am sure that if it came to implementing this design, my finished product would be quite different to the diagram as I discovered
                                different things I needed a class to do, or different attributes I needed it to have.
                                </p>

                                <p><strong>Difficulties</strong></p>
                                <p>The main diffficulty I encountered was trying to deal with people who are both staff members and customers.
                                I think this really highlighted some shortcomings in my initial approach. I wanted Person to be an interface that was implemented by both
                                the Staff and Customer classes. This meant that a "real life person" would be instantiated from either the Customer or the Staff class, and
                                so, if a staff member wanted to buy something, there would be two different objects for the same person.</p>
                                <p> In the end, I think I got around this successfully, by reversing the direction of the arrows between Customer, Staff and Person. In this
                                revised design, Customer and Staff became interfaces that are implemented by Person. That means that a person can be both a customer and a
                                member without being represented by two different objects.
                                </p>

									<h3>Reflecting on UML class diagrams (Part 2)</h3>
								</header>
                                <p>In weeks 5 and 6, we were tasked with creating a set of diagrams for the process of a GP's receptionist taking a booking for an appointment.</p>
								<strong><p>TASK:</strong>
									In this week’s activity, you are going to get some hands-on practice with UML, with a scenario, which is described below. You have been asked to
									develop UML diagrams for a doctor’s surgery based on the following scenario:

									Before a patient can see a doctor, or nurse, they will be required to make an appointment. The appointment will be made by the receptionist.
									However, before making the appointment, the receptionist needs to ask the patient which doctor they would like to see, and whether the appointment
									is standard consultation or an emergency appointment. The receptionist will use this information to check the appointment schedule, find an
									available appointment and make the booking. During the appointment itself, the doctor may issue the patient with a prescription. It is possible
									for a patient to request a repeat prescription be raised. Receptionists are able to cancel appointments as well as create them. A doctor at the
									clinic may have a maximum of 500 patients registered to them at any one time.</p>
                                <p>We had to create three diagrams:\nA class diagram for the system.\n
									A sequence diagram for booking an appointment.\n
									An activity diagram for a receptionist booking an appointment.</p>
